# Book Market Trends and Consumer Behavior Post-COVID Era ðŸ“šðŸ“Š

The coronavirus took the whole world by surprise, changing people's routines. City dwellers no longer spent their free time away from home, going to cafes and shopping malls; Most stayed at home reading books. This caught the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers.

I have received a database from one of the competing services in that market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and book reviews. This information will be used to generate a valid proposition for the new product.
